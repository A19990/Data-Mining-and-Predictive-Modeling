# Data-Mining-and-Predictive-Modeling

This project covers data mining and predictive modeling tasks based on four applied exercises. It includes linear regression, time series forecasting, classification using dimensionality reduction (PCA), and clustering analysis. The goal is to explore real-world datasets and apply statistical and machine learning techniques to solve practical problems.

## Exercises Overview

- **Exercise 1 – Regression Analysis**  
  Analysis of lung function data using linear regression models with and without variable interactions. Model comparison is done via repeated cross-validation.

- **Exercise 2 – Time Series Forecasting**  
  Forecasting mortality data using exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. Model performance is evaluated using MAPE and residual diagnostics.

- **Exercise 3 – Classification with PCA**  
  Binary classification of breast cancer diagnoses. Includes correlation analysis, dimensionality reduction via PCA, and predictive modeling.

- **Exercise 4 – Clustering**  
  Clustering of Spanish regions based on demographic and electoral data. Involves data preprocessing, hierarchical clustering, k-means, and biplot interpretation.
